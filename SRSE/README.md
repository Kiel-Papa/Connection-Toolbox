# SpiderRock Storage Engine (SRSE)
SRSE provides a way for customers to view scoped SpiderRock data by using SQL commands from any SQL client. Customers would be granted access, log into whatever SQL client they prefer and connect to the SRSE which would provide several tables of data they can browse or mine data out of. Although automation could be created through this connection it is recommended that MLink be used for automation purposes. 

## How to Gain Access
To access SRSE, reach out to the SpiderRock Support Desk. A representative will assist in enabling your existing SpiderRock ID for SRSE access. Following authorization, you will receive the necessary connection details.

## How to Use
After connecting to SRSE from your SQL client, simply use SQL commands to perform certain actions. `SELECT` and `UPDATE` commands are supported allowing you to view and modify your orders as needed. 

Example: Executing `SELECT * FROM msguserconfig;` retrieves the users you have access to (limited to your client firm)
