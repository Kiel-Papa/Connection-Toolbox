# SpiderRock Storage Engine (SRSE)
SRSE provides a way for customers to view scoped SpiderRock data by using SQL commands from any SQL client. Customers would be granted access, log into whatever SQL client they prefer and connect to the SRSE which would provide several tables of data they can browse or mine data out of. Although automation could be created through this connection, it is not recommended this method be used for that purpose, instead MLink should be used. 

## How to Gain Access
Contact a SpiderRock Support Desk representative would can enable your existing SpiderRock ID to have access to SRSE. Once the appropriate access is granted, you would recieve connection details. 

## How to Use
After connecting to SRSE from your SQL client, simply use SQL commands to perform certain actions. `SELECT` and `UPDATE` commands are supported allowing your to not only view your orders but also modify them if needed. 

Example: `SELECT * FROM msguserconfig;` would retrieve all of the users you have access to (limited to your client firm)
